<h1>For context, my school's name is Visitation</h1>
<h2>Hello! I'm Sara Koka, and I was put on the task to create a chatbot for my school! I faced a few challenges with push and pull requests...GOOD THING i had screenshotted my code earlier just incase this would happen. So, I was able to just copy and paste the code back into the codespace. I used HTML, CSS, and a lot of JS. The JS was hard to edit because if one question was messed up, that meant all the other questions had to be fixed also. I also had some trouble with the message-design style because when I would edit the color of the text, ALL the text was edited rather than just the user's input. Finally, I did get it to work and gave it to the school for a first-prototype!! I will be adding some more questions in later when I am given them.</h2>
